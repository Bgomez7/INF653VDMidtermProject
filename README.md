# INF653VDMidtermProject

This project was developed for INF653VD Back-End Web Development I.

The goal of the project is to develop a REST API using at least three models and have appropriate "Create, Read, Update, Delete" (CRUD) operations for each. As well as correct "Model-View-Controller(MVC)" file structure and "PHP Data Objects" (PDO) design. Another aim of the project is to deploy the app using any service of our choosing.
